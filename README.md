# Early Classification Step


## Installation

### Requirements

To install the required packages run
```python
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Downloading and installing the model

We are using the zip model from `alercebroker/stamp_classifier` releases.
[model.zip (v1.0.1)](https://github.com/alercebroker/stamp_classifier/releases/download/1.0.0/model.zip)


The Early Classification Step expect the model inside the `model` folder.
```bash
  unzip model.zip -c model
```

Then we need to install the model's required packages.
```python
  pip install -r model/requirements.txt
```
